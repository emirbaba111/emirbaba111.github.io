module ClockManager(
    input logic clk_in,
    output logic clk_out
);
    // Implementation of clock management logic
    // ...
endmodule
```

## Architecture
The architecture of the Adaptive Clock Management system is designed to be modular and efficient. It consists of several key components:

- **Clock Divider Module**: Responsible for generating different clock frequencies.
